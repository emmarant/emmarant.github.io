**Current research projects:** 

- _Alignment of neutron optics_: <br> I am exploring DL models for fast, automatic alignement of neutron focusing lenses. 
I develop and train 2D CNN models using simulated datasets (images) which I create using the ray-tracing code <a href="https://www.mcstas.org">McStas</a>.
- _Real-time surveillance of single-crystal material synthesis_:<br>
A project in collaboration with former intern Mahyar Joodaki and the Solid State Chemistry group at PSI. We are developing a 3D CNN model able to  monitor     the process of single crystal synthesis and provide real-time actionable feedback, removing thus the need for continuous supervision of the crystal growth process (lasting from a few hours to days) by a human operator.
- _Classification of crystal symmetries  from X-ray diffraction data_. <br>

- _Wavelength prediction of single neutron events on scintillation cameras_.<br>
In collaboration with the Imaging Group at PSI, I am developing a DL-based software for detection and energy characterization of single neutron events on scintillator cameras. The goal is to simplify the experimental setup in neutron beamlines allowing for 'simple' scintillation cameras to be used as detectors without the need for energy selectors/differentiators like monochromators or choppers.
