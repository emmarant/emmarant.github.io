**Current research projects:** 


- _Alignment of neutron optics_  [<i class="fas fa-fw fa-video" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14YZKxwzTCA2Qw2MnRpMon2S01l2rFRu6/view?usp=sharing 'short intro movie on neutron optics alignment with DL')

<br> <span style="color:gray">I am exploring DL models for fast, automatic alignement of neutron focusing lenses. 
I develop and train 2D CNN models using simulated datasets (images) which I create using the ray-tracing code <a href="https://www.mcstas.org">McStas</a>.
The final model, although trained on simulated images, is deployed on measured (i.e. 'real') ones, which makes the project interestingly challenging.</span>

- _Real-time surveillance of single-crystal material synthesis_ <br>
<span style="color:gray"> A project in collaboration with former intern Mahyar Joodaki and the Solid State Chemistry group at PSI. We are developing a 3D CNN model able to  monitor the process of single crystal synthesis and provide real-time actionable feedback, removing thus the need for continuous supervision of the crystal growth process (lasting from a few hours to days) by a human operator. </span>

- _Classification of crystal symmetries  from X-ray diffraction data_ <br>
<span style="color:gray">In collaboration with colleagues at University of Zurich, I am working on boosting the performance of DL classification of crystal symmetries  from XRDs.
The interesting part from a computational point, is that training is performed on simulated data (labeled measured data are extremely sparce but simulated data are abundand and 'easily' created), yet the model is then deployed on measured data.</span> 


- _Wavelength prediction of single neutron events on scintillation cameras_ <br>
<span style="color:gray">In collaboration with the Imaging Group at PSI, I am developing a DL-based software for detection and energy characterization of single neutron events on scintillation cameras. The goal is to simplify the experimental setup in neutron beamlines allowing for 'simple' scintillation cameras to be used as detectors without the need for energy selectors/differentiators like monochromators or choppers.</span>
