**Current research projects:** 

- _Alignment of neutron optics_: <br> I am developing a DL model for fast, automatic alignement of neutron focusing lenses. 
- _Real-time surveillance of single-crystal material synthesis_: ... 
  A project in collaboration with former intern Mahyar Joodaki and the Solid State Chemistry group at PSI. We are developing a 3D CNN model able to  monitor     the process of single crystal synthesis and provide real-time actionable feedback. 
- Classification of crystal symmetries  from X-ray diffraction data.
- Wavelength prediction of single neutron events on scintillation cameras.
