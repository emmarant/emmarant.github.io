**Current research projects:** 

- _Alignment of neutron optics_: <br> I am exploring DL models for fast, automatic alignement of neutron focusing lenses. 
I develop and train 2D CNN models using simulated datasets (images) which I create using the ray-tracing code <a href="https://www.mcstas.org">McStas</a>.
- _Real-time surveillance of single-crystal material synthesis_:<br>
A project in collaboration with former intern Mahyar Joodaki and the Solid State Chemistry group at PSI. We are developing a 3D CNN model able to  monitor     the process of single crystal synthesis and provide real-time actionable feedback. 
- _Classification of crystal symmetries  from X-ray diffraction data_.

- _Wavelength prediction of single neutron events on scintillation cameras_.
